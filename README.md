## Winsock, WIN32 client server program(s) w/ MinGW GCC port
Simple client server written in C with winsock using the MinGW GCC compiler port... I also use the Win32 CreateThread process to make it handle concurrent requests better
The purpose of this repo is to eventually turn it into a game server for my mushroom fighter project and learn low level network concepts !
